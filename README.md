#Implementation of Will Hero Game using Java,JavaFX,SceneBuilder and OOPS Concepts

The code is an implementation of Will Hero Game (originally developed by Z Play games) using Java, JavaFX and OOP concepts. The game has various features including different themes/backgrounds, save game/restart game options using which multiple game states can be saved and reloaded. This uses serialization and deserialization concepts. Navigation in the game is done via FXML files, some of which are made using Scene Builder. The code uses Facade and Factory design patterns. The flow of the Game is as follows: - Initial Main Menu allows the user to Play the Game and View saved Games.
In the Game Orcs, Obstacles and Treasure Chests arrive as the game progress.
Anytime the user falls down below a certain level he needs to resurrect using coin or has to start a new game if he fails to do so.
The Game supports 2 weapons namely Axe and Rocket each of which kills the Orcs on hitting it.
If the Hero touches the Orc horizontally the orc falls down in to the abyss.
After completing 100 steps the hero fights the boss. Defeating the boss makes the hero win the game.

The code helped me to learn about various object-oriented principles and design patterns. I also learned about the importance of object-oriented programming when working on a somewhat big project and how to solve some of the challenges with regard to code maintenance.
Along with that I learned how to use Scene Builder to create frames/scenes of the game.
The most crucial thing that I learnt was the use of JavaFX and Java to make characters animate using different kinds of animations that require updating the coordinates in real time. It was also initially challenging to handle various cases of collision, which I finally did using the Animation Timer class. Another critical aspect of the project was the serialization and deserialization part to save and reload the game. With regard to that I learned how to save list of objects efficiently.
Apart from this I also learned how to make use of tools like Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Express to extract GUI components for the game characters and objects.
